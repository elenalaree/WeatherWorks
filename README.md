Dual weather finder.

This weather finder was built with the idea of being able to compare the weather differences between 2 cities. It allows for favoriting and removing of those combinations.

## Description

THis program uses a combination of Javascript, css, and HTML to make the weather visible. It used OpenWeatherAPI for the weather calls. It finds the city names and then coordinates and sends them to another api that gets the next four days' weather.
