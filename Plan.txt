1. Overview:
    I plan to allow users to search for 2 cities at once so they can compare the weather in each.

2. Audience would be people looking to move to another place or seeing what the weather difference is between two cities.

3. The major functions of this app would be to pull up 2 cities 5 day forcast side by side for a comparison. A ability to save cities as favorites.

5. OpenWeatherMap, local storage.

6. Modules include favorites page, main page. If these are not modules, I feel like modules wasn't explained well enough for me to offer a description.
